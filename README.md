# React Weather App 🌦️

A classic weather application built with **React** – one of those "evergreen" projects often chosen to showcase React skills.

This app integrates multiple libraries and APIs:
- **OpenWeatherMap API** for real-time weather and forecasts
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive maps
- **Recharts** for forecast charts
- **React Spring** for animations
- **React Hot Toast** for notifications
- **TailwindCSS + DaisyUI** for UI styling

---

## ✨ Features
- Search for any city and get current weather data
- 5-day weather forecast with charts (temperature, humidity, wind)
- Interactive map with Leaflet markers
- Add/remove favorite cities (saved in localStorage)
- Light/Dark theme toggle
- Animated card transitions

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React (with Vite)
- Axios
- Lodash (debounce)
- TailwindCSS + DaisyUI
- Leaflet
- Recharts
- React Spring

## ⚠️ Note
This project is **for demonstration purposes only**.
I'm aware that the code could benefit from further **refactoring** (state management, hooks cleanup, etc.), but the goal is to show a working React application that combines multiple skills and tools.

---

## 🚀 Demo
Clone the repo, install dependencies and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in the root with your own OpenWeatherMap API key:

```
VITE_OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
